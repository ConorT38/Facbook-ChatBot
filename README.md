# Facbook-Spammer

<h1>Overview:</h1>
This is a simple bot that can click on the chat window, then the input box, then you can type in the message, or prepare a message you would like to send out to people, and then set to how many times/what time in between messages and how often it will send these messages. This is a good tool for starting out on making bots for various software!

</h3><b>Modules:</b></h3>
-ctypes
-time

<h1>Edit:</h1>
Been a few years since I made this, and looking back now it would be better to implement this in something like Selenium Webdriver.
